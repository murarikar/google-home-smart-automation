# Google Home Smart Automation - "I'm Leaving" Routine

This project is a submission for the **Google Home API Developer Challenge 2025**. It uses the **Google Home Playground** to simulate a virtual smart home and automate device control through a routine.

## 🌟 Routine: "I'm Leaving"

The **"I'm Leaving"** routine automatically powers down key smart devices to help conserve energy when the user leaves their home.

### 🎯 Trigger
- When the user says: “I’m leaving”
- OR taps the routine in the Google Home app

### ⚙️ Actions
- Turn off all connected **lights**
- Turn off **outlet**
- Turn off the **AC**
- Close the **blinds**

These actions are defined using the routine editor in the **Google Home app**, connected to the virtual devices created in the **Google Home Playground**.
